<blockquote>
"This is the first introductory book I would strongly recommend
to anyone who wants to learn how to construct computer programs
. . . if you are looking for a book to thrust into the hands
of someone who wants to be initiated into the power and pleasures
of programming, this book is the best I have seen yet."

"The book should be obligatory for anyone involved in teaching
computer science at degree level: it will convince them that inside
computer science there really is a true science trying to get out."

<dd><b>David Barron</b>, <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>
</dl>
<p>
<br>
"Because of its clarity, simplicity and wit, this work is highly
recommended to anyone seeking an understanding of the emerging
paradigms of computer science . . . the book should be read by every
self-respecting computer scientist."

"My only problem with this book is the fact that it is far too
fascinating for a first course in computing.  I tried to browse it,
but I was immediately sucked into reading every wonderful word.  Be
warned: don't open a copy of this book until you are ready for a
programming feast."
