<blockquote> <font size=-1> <b>Wizard Book</b> n. Hal Abelson's, Jerry Sussman's 
  and Julie Sussman's <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> 
  (MIT Press, 1984; ISBN 0-262-01077-1), an excellent computer science text used 
  in introductory courses at MIT. So called because of the wizard on the jacket. 
  One of the bibles of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less commonly, known as the 
  Purple Book.

      <em>SICP</em> uses the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Scheme implementations are 
      available for most common platforms. From MIT, we supply free implementations 
      of the MIT Scheme programming environment. This page provides information 
      on how to obtain copies of MIT Scheme as well as other implementations.
