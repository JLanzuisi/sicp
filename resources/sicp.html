<b>Wizard Book</b> n. Hal Abelson's, Jerry Sussman's and Julie Sussman's
<i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> (MIT Press, 1984;
ISBN 0-262-01077-1), an excellent computer science text used in
introductory courses at MIT. So called because of the wizard on the
jacket. One of the bibles of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less
commonly, known as the Purple Book.

     <em>SICP</em> uses the Scheme dialect of Lisp.  Scheme implementations
     are available for most common platforms.  From MIT, we supply
     free implementations of the MIT Scheme programming environment.
     This page provides information on how to obtain copies of MIT
     Scheme as well as other implementations.
